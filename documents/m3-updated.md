# Blue Magic : Milestone 3 UPDATED
## After we re-designed our app.

## Persuasive Design Approach

- Approach:
    - We realized our original design was not persuasive towards the actual target of the problem our users were facing, which is about motivation to get to the Farmers Market. Our design now draws on and evokes people's intrinstic motivations by suggesting motivations they might have for going to the Farmers Market, and then reminding them of these in a timely and engaging way. Our app is meant to be like a buddy to keep you accountable and positive, and help you achieve your own goals. 

- Behavior Trying to Influence:
    - Our target audience are people who have reason to go to the market but might need an extra push to remind themselves to go and what their initial motivations are. The target behavior our app is trying to influence is actually going to the market rather than just wanting to. Specifically, we would like users to go to the market at least twice as often as they currently do (at least once if never been, or twice a month if only go once a month usually). 'Going' to the Farmers Market, according to our app's structure, simply means physically going to the location of the market that the user made a plan to go to. 

- Current obstacles to this target behavior:
    - There are two key obstacles to people going to the market more often, in the way described above. First, people do not know all of the opportunities the Ithaca Farmers Market presents (i.e. the different Market locations, special events, and the different activities possible to do), so they are not likely to change their behavior if they do not feel it is worth it to go, if they do not see anything unique and valuable about going to the Market. Second, people do not have enough time to go to the market as often as they like, and it can seem like a lot of effort to plan an excursion to the market, especially if you don't have a consistent schedule and reliable transportation.

- How our design accomplishes our target behavior:
    - Our design accomplishes this behavior by presenting the user with all the information and motivation necessary to give them this knowledge they lack and convince them that going to the Market will be worth it. This is done by allowing the user to set a reminder for what day to go to the market and their primary motivations and goals they are trying to accomplish by going to the market. We also have a geolocation feature which rewards the user if they do end up going to the market, which further incentivizes the user to complete this behavior. Every time the user goes to the market after planning to, the app ups the user's level, and gives positive reinforcement for going to the market, and encourages the user to continue this behavior. There is also an element of discovery for each level (changing app color for each level increase), to further incentivize the user to achieve new levels. Essentially, every time the user opens the app after setting a reminder, they will be reminded of the reasons they wanted to go to the market and be provided with timely information to ensure they can meet this goal. 

## Brainstorming

- Initial idea: app that shows basic transportation option information and provides a forum for people to talk about transportation and coordinate it
  - Badge for top contributors
  - Categories for posts
    - Looking for ridesharing
    - Transport advice
    - Deals and special vendors
    - safety/info announcements
    - Community event/gathering
- More ideas
  - Recommended routes you could walk or bike down with QR codes you can scan along the way so if you show you walked down you get points or a badge or it contributes to leaderboard or something?
    - Could get a discount at the market
    - Or get badge for forum
  - Easy way to limebike as opposed to google maps, simplified with an arrow that always points you towards the market
  - A ridesharing app that if you take a picture showing you gave a ride/took a ride with someone else, you get points (to tackle the issue of parking)
  - An app that tracks your carbon footprint based on what mode of transportation you use (i.e car, bike) and you can see the environmental impact you are having
  - An app that demonstrates the background/contact info of all vendors of the Ithaca Farmers Market and allows users to favorite booths and turn on suggestions by inputting preferences on what the user hopes to get out of the market - Also has a newsfeed tab that informs users if there are performances, specials, deals
  - Information app with character select in a video game and you select your mode of transportation and it gives you more information and helpful tidbits
    - Even if you drive, it shows you where else you could park etc
    - General idea: selectively show info based on what the user wants to do
      - Might need incentive to contribute to tips
      - Reducing barriers to accessing information
  - If we’re going to include any aspects of ridesharing, make sure either its in a separate place or there’s some way to communicate w/o publicly sharing one’s phone number
    - Might create the barrier of needing an account to use the app
    - Extra step turns potential users away
    - Safety issue of publicly posting information
    - Verification via location
  - Exchanging money for services might raise issues
  - People want other ways of getting there besides getting a ride

  - Idea development/redesign
    - want to cater to people's intrinsic motivations/barriers
    - what if we do something where people can get information based on whether or not they want to go to the market?
      - have a page that addresses each specific barrier
      - still give transportation info but only if the user wants it
      - this seems kind of single use though??
    - give people reasons to go, or remind them of the reasons they want to go
      - draws on people's intrinsic motivations
      - persuasive
      - use notifications for timely reminders
    - use levels to incentivize going

### Sketches
  - Initial redesign ideas: a flowchart-like structured app which provides users the information they need based on their current knowledge and prefrences, and still incorporates plenty of info about transportation. 
  [Page 1 of first redesign](m3_images/initial-redesign-yes.JPG)
  
  [Page 2 of first redesign](m3_images/initial-redesign-no.JPG)
  
  - we then discussed and realized we need to stop focusing so much on transportation, because the real issue lies in people being unmotivated to actually go to the market. so our final redesign is based upon the idea of drawing on people's motivations and reminding people of these, and rewarding attending the market. we realized our initial redesign didn't hold up well for multiple uses, so our redesign process also focused on making an app that encourages continuous use. 

  - The following is a messy page of sketching and discussing new design ideas.

  - The following is our first final redesign, which re-centers the focus from transportation and single-use to multiple use for scheduling a trip, with necessary info we want to convey to the user built in to the planning process.

- Note: once we realized that push notifications are not possible, we redesigned to accommodate for this. Check out Milestone 4 for an even more updated final sketch, but the above sketch is true to what our design was at this stage in our process.


## Rationale

Initially, we were bulding an app for community members to help each other get to the farmer's market. However, after revisiting our interviews, we realized that the problem was not transportation. People don't go through the hassle of finding a way to get to the farmer's market because they lack motivation. Our redesigned app is built to appeal to people who are interested in visiting the farmer's market more often. Our approach to meeting this interest is to provide a place where people can view upcoming farmers market dates and set specific reminders to keep their intention to visit the market relevant. To accomplish this, we're including a design focused on selecting specific motivations, to remind people of specific reasons they wanted to visit the market. This easy to follow, reschedule and remind persuasive design will motivate people to plan a visit the farmer's market and be incentivized for it by leveling up.

In our user interviews done at the market itself, we heard people talk about how they liked to be present for events like acapella concerts and the annual rutabaga curl. This informed the ‘day panels’ on the home page of our app, where people can easily see what interesting events may be happening on a given day.

# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a _living_ document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. Team name or project name. Plus full name and NetID of each of your team members.
   TEAM BLUE MAGIC!
   Zoe Roberts - zer3
   Nick Markus- ntm27
   Viri Garcia - vg235
   Joseph Mo - jjm492
   Neha Rao - nr276

2. To what goals do we all commit?

- To work effectively together to implement a project that we are all proud of
- To practice skills that we are less familiar with in order to strengthen these skills
- To ensure everyone gets to work on a diverse set of tasks in order to get to both design and code within this project

3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

- Respect each other and listen to what everyone has to say
- Execute your responsibilities to the best of your ability
- Refer to this contract in the case of conflicts

4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

- Typically, we will meet in person on set days in which everyone is available
  (tentative date to be coordinated). In the case that we are all not able
  to meet we will communicate through texting the group chat that has already
  been set up. Meetings will occur on a weekly basis.

5. How will we communicate and work with our client?
- We will all communicate with our client via e-mail
- We can also set up in-person meetings with our client
- If we think that an in-person meeting is required but someone can't make it, we can phone them in via zoom or skype

6. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.
- Git syncer will be in charge of pushing, pulling and making sure everyone is editing on the same version of the files. This can be a
rotating position. For example, one person might do it for one week, then someone else.
- Scheduler will send out whentomeet links to the group and gauge what best time is to set up a meeting for everyone
- Reminder will check up on the project periodically to make sure things look like they're on track or remind people to get a specific task done if it hasn't been done

7. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?
- If someone is having trouble with something, or life stuff comes up that prevents completing work as expected, they will communicate with everyone about the situation as soon as possible, and give updates about what help they might need and when team members can expect them to get on track
- We will give friendly reminders to each other and give team members the benefit of the doubt and then respectfully and openly communicate if there is a specific issue that leads to negative impacts on other team members
- To a team member who appears not to be contributing equally/not meeting the expectations, we will first express this concern directly to the individual, ideally in person so there can be a productive conversation
- If there are further issues, we can come back to this contract, talk to the professor, and/or create more specific/organized means for ensuring equal and effective work

8. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?
- When we disagree or encounter conflict, we should seek open and honest communication, rather than gossip or holding grudges
- We should try to work out conflicts in person, so that productive conversation can occur (following principles of dialogue - to reach mutual understanding, rather than debate - to 'win over' the other side)

9. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?
- if 3 out of 5 group members agree that something is wrong with the contract, the team will meet in-person to discuss further ammendments and changes that may need to be made
- Since our goal is to have the contract function as a living document, it will matter that we think critically about what it entails of us and that we can change whichever rules don't work.

10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a _fun_ clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)
- Every team meeting someone will be cosen to present a funny joke or meme they saw in the last couple days. This will be a rotating role and everyone will have to present a meme
- Over the semester we will work to put together a blue-magic themed spotify playlist to listen to while working. We each contribute 1-2 songs we think the others will appreciate and ejoy while studying and working

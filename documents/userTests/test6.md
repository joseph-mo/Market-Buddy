### Scenario 1:  You expressed to a friend interest in making a recipe that requires many kinds of fresh vegetables, and they suggested going to the farmer's market to buy them. You are interested in trying this out, and want to make sure you remember to go for this purpose, this weekend.

- User was not sure how to navigate between weeks
- Eventually figured it out
- Was able to set up a day to go

### Scenario 2: You want to go to find a unique gift for your mom, but you are very busy for the next few weeks and want to see if there are any weekdays where there is a farmer's market day you can get non-food items.
- User planned their visit on a weekday, with no difficulties navigating weeks this time

### Scenario 3: You scheduled yourself to visit the farmer's market this weekend, but a friend invited you to go to Syracuse instead, so you want to reschedule your visit for the following weekend.
- User had trouble choosing a button to reschedule their trip

### Notes:
- Once more, it seems that the buttons for changing/selecting the week were not very obvious
- It needs to be more clear what exactly the Edit and Cancel buttons do on the very last screen

### Scenario 1:  You expressed to a friend interest in making a recipe that requires many kinds of fresh vegetables, and they suggested going to the farmer's market to buy them. You are interested in trying this out, and want to make sure you remember to go for this purpose, this weekend.

- James scrolled up and down on the website, pausing before clicking on anything
- Decided to go to the December 13th date 
- 'so I just pick a day I want to go'
- 'oh, so its tracking if I went to the market or no'

### Scenario 2: You want to go to find a unique gift for your mom, but you are very busy for the next few weeks and want to see if there are any weekdays where there is a farmer's market day you can get non-food items.

- James selected a different date
- He took a moment to read through the motivations this time around
- 'yeah this pretty much enocompasses everything about the farmer's market'
- 'Does the prompt appear after I've been?


### Scenario 3: You scheduled yourself to visit the farmer's market this weekend, but a friend invited you to go to Syracuse instead, so you want to reschedule your visit for the following weekend.

- James had trouble changing the week by clicking on the 'reschedule' button

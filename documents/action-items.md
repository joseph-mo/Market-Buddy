## Interview Organization (Executive Summary of User Needs/Goals)

- Key Person: Viri
  Organize your submission. Clearly state how many users you interviewed/studied. Provide a brief summary of each user and what you learned from them. Lastly, provide an executive summary of key points that you learned about the users' needs/goals. Note, you will likely need to use affinity diagramming (document this process with photos) to help you identify themes in your data.

Interview Summaries (8 interviews total):
    - Acapella Girls:
        Key motivations: singing for performance, food, ambiance, occasional fun thing to do
        Key barriers: transit and driving, need car and even so hard to find parking 
    - Ag Student:
        Key motivations: Works here, family runs farm, getting food
        Key barriers: Nothing really
    - Andrew:
        Key motivations: Going with friends
        Key barriers: Lack of transportation
    - Caroline:

## Problem

- Key person: Joe

What problems did you identify from gathering data? These problems will help you identify what your app will be addressing. e.g. Did your users need help finding the location of eggplant at the market? (Many vendors switch locations every week)

You don't have a lot of time to build an app that solves every problem. Identify 1 or 2 key problems that your team wants to address. Mark these clearly in your submission. I strongly encourage you to identify these sooner rather than later and discuss them with the professor so he can help you limit the scope of your project.

Problems:

1. Transportation. Many if not all of our users had obstacles regarding transportation and found it to be one of the main
   inconveniences with the Farmer's Market. During our information gathering, we found that the main barrier users experienced
   with the Farmer's Market was not necessarily during there time there, but rather was actually physically traveling to the market.
   Moreover, for those who drove to the market, parking also seemed to be an issue during peak hours, which we thought went hand in
   hand with transportation as a whole. In addition, traveling to the market without a car seemed to be an even bigger hassle,
   as our users were frustrated with confusing bus routes, lack of ubers, expensive ubers, and time constraints that made going
   to the market not as favorable.

## Value Propositions

- Key Person: Neha

In homework 1 we studied McKay's Planning Phase in Chapter 5 of your text. Now that you've gathered information from the users and identified key problems, take the time to identify what value your system may bring to your users.

You should define the value propositions of your product. These value propositions should address the key problems you identified. You need to identify why your users will want to use your product. See your text for examples.

## Scenarios

- Key person: Zoe

We need to understand how users will use the app from their point of view. You will author scenarios that you will use for the remaining milestones. Recall that a scenario = user + task + context.

Produce a scenario for each key problem/value proposition. Note you will likely need more scenarios.

## Personas

- Key person: Nick

We'll need a persona to inform the design in the next milestone. Produce a persona.

# Market Buddy

Application URL: blue-magic-project.herokuapp.com

Initially, we were bulding an app for community members to help each other get to the farmer's market. However, after revisiting our interviews, we realized that the problem was not transportation. People don't go through the hassle of finding a way to get to the farmer's market because they lack motivation. Our redesigned app is built to appeal to people who are interested in visiting the farmer's market more often. Our approach to meeting this interest is to provide a place where people can view upcoming farmers market dates and set specific reminders to keep their intention to visit the market relevant. To accomplish this, we're including a design focused on selecting specific motivations, to remind people of specific reasons they wanted to visit the market. This easy to follow, reschedule and remind persuasive design will motivate people to plan a visit the farmer's market and be incentivized for it by leveling up.

In our user interviews done at the market itself, we heard people talk about how they liked to be present for events like acapella concerts and the annual rutabaga curl. This informed the ‘day panels’ on the home page of our app, where people can easily see what interesting events may be happening on a given day.
